# Introduction

The SPIRE project is hosted on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Tokyo-09/spire).

SPIRE is being developed as a robust malware protection solution for both Linux and Windows, aimed at protecting end users from known malware and threats.

## Motivation

- **Purpose of the Project**: Initially, my goal was to create a firewall to deepen my understanding of the Rust programming language. While exploring relevant resources, I frequently encountered publications from antivirus companies, which piqued my interest. This led me to pivot towards developing my own antivirus software. Given the scarcity of open-source projects and resources on this topic on GitHub and elsewhere, I decided to contribute to this domain by building a novel solution.
- **Choice of Rust**: My primary objective was to enhance my proficiency in the Rust programming language, known for its performance and safety features.
- **Use of Multiple Languages** : While Rust offers significant advantages, creating comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) applications with it currently poses challenges. Consequently, I selected Python for developing the user interface due to its simplicity and accessibility. For server-side development, I chose Go for its efficiency and suitability for my requirements.

# Project Roadmap

SPIRE is under active development, with ongoing updates and refinements. Progress can be tracked via my [GitHub Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Tokyo-09/projects/2), where all tasks are meticulously documented, or through the detailed feature list below.

## Planned Features

### Client
1. Transmit suspicious files to the server for detailed analysis [  ]
2. Log activities, collect system data, and send it to the server [  ]
3. Enable automatic database updates from the server [  ]
4. Implement configuration management [  ]
...

### Core
1. Scan specified directories for threats [ X ]
2. Perform scans using YARA rules [ X ]
3. Conduct behavioral analysis of files [  ]
4. Enable real-time monitor mode [  ]
5. Implement TCP/IP filtering for malicious hosts and ports [  ]
6. Scan newly created files on disk for static Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) [  ]
7. Analyze newly created files for Import Address Table (IAT) patterns [  ]
8. Execute files in a sandbox upon detection of an executable launching from the kernel [  ]
...

### Server
1.  Develop cloud-based file scanning capabilities [  ]
2.  Create a basic website and API for the application [  ]
...

# Conclusion

I am highly enthusiastic about the potential of the SPIRE project, as the field of antivirus protection captivates my interest, and I am committed to its continued development. This blog serves to document the development process comprehensively, capturing both the progress made and the challenges encountered.
